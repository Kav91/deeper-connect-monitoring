# New Relic - View your logs

- In New Relic, click on the "Logs" section or click [here.](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher)

- If you are prompted to `Enable Logs` you have not shipped any logs to New Relic and something could be potentially wrong with your logging configuration.\
    - Ensure you have moved the logging configuration file over as previously documented
    - In Windows check if a `sharing.log` file was created in C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\newrelic-integrations\.deeper-logs\
    - In Linux/Mac check if a `sharing.log` file was created in /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/.deeper-logs/
    - If there is not, go one directory up and go into the `.deeper-cli.cache` folder and delete any files that contain the word `.sharing-log-marker`, this will force 1 day worth of logging to re-ingest.
- If you don't see any logs, then adjust the time picker to go further back incase you haven't had any traffic recently.
