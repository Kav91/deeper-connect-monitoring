These alerts are defined via NRQL (New Relic Query Language) as you can see it is very similar to SQL. You can add your own alert conditions or edit and tailor them to your needs. See the next section on how to query all your data which will be useful in setting further [NRQL alerts.](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/)
