# Viewing data in New Relic

In New Relic, click `Query your data` in the top right menu alternatively it could be a small command symbol if your screen width is small.

## SQL style querying with NRQL (New Relic Query Language)

If you are familiar with SQL or database querying, go to the `Query Builder` tab.

The New Relic query language is quite forgiving so you can even start your query with the `FROM` clause.

A query maybe populated for you already, however you can replace it and run a query like below for example.

For more information on [NRQL querying see here.](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/)

You can set alerts with your NRQL queries also, [see here.](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/)

## [Building dashboards](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/)

Now that you are armed with the knowledge of where to find your data, you would have noticed some buttons such as select chart type and add to dashboard, this is a great way to shortcut into dashboards, if you'd like.

However if you want to get the most out of dashboards, view the docs [here.](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/)
